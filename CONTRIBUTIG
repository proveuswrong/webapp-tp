## Organization Guideline

### Styling

Use SCSS for targeting elements in general and use CSS Modules for targeting only a single element.
Strive to find common styling rules to be able to put styling rules in global files to avoid duplications.
Follow the SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) methodology to organize SCSS files.

To achieve a responsive design, we use [fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) and a [typographic scale](https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/).
